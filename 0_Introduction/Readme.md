## Introduction
Data parallelism in C++ helps us to access the parallel resources in a modern heteroenous system. A single C++ application can use any combination of devices available such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs etc.
We do data parallel programming using C++ and SYCL (pronounce as 'SICKLE').
SYCL is basically an industry driven Khronos standard that adds data parallelism to C++ for heterogenous systems.
DPC++ is basically an open source **compiler** project created by Intel employees. It is based on SYCL and heterogenous support that includes CPU, GPU and FPGAs.
